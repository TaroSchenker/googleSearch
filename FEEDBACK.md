# Feedback
Taro &Thilaks searchEngine
#### Key points
- Very good organisation.
- file system and code clear and readable.
- Clear README instructions

## Client

#### js
index.js -> super neat and organised.
script.js -> again, very clear and good code but could do with a little cleaning up before deployment.

#### styles
- Very clear and concisely written.
- DRY - when using the same variable multiple times it is recommended to store this in the root
example:
```
root {
  --white: #00ffff;
}
```

#### static
- Please include alt tags & labels when required.
- please include a global language in html (lang=en)
- Would recommend using a h1 tag (again for accessibility purposes).
- Note: WAVE also recommends adding a heading structure and page regions with ARIA landmarks
